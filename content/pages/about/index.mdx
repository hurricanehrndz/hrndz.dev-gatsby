I am Carlos Hernandez, aka HurricaneHrndz. I am a self-professed Tech Fanatic who loves to learn and share knowledge.  What's more, I have been fortunate to do so for over 20 years.

Currently, I live and work in Calgary, Alberta Canada. This suits my sense of adventure just perfectly. When I am not enthusiastically coding, you are likely to find me trekking the Rockies getting my adrenaline fill.

My unique sense of adventure and thirst for knowledge proves invaluable in my life. Undoubtedly, first and foremost, with the one of a kind outdoor experiences lived. More surprisingly, though, it pays dividends within in my career.  For it is the same unique combination of characteristics that fearlessly guides me to the cutting edge of technology, helping me develop some unique technical skills. Personally, I can not wait for the next adventure, and I hope you will join me!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
